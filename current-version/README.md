# Current Version - Preserved Implementation

This folder contains the existing dashboard implementations that were in use before the professional redesign process.

## Files
- `service_dashboard_themed.html` - Main service control dashboard
- `financial_dashboard.html` - Financial metrics dashboard  
- `production_monitor_dashboard.html` - Production monitoring dashboard
- `development_pipeline_dashboard.html` - Development pipeline dashboard
- `start_control_center.py` - Python server for service control

## Status
These files represent the "hobbyist" implementation that prompted the professional redesign initiative. They are preserved here for:
- Reference and comparison purposes
- Functionality analysis during redesign
- Rollback capability if needed
- Learning from existing patterns

## Issues Identified
- Visual appearance lacks professional business aesthetic
- Service status reporting shows false "running" status
- Doesn't fully implement Light Blue HTML5 theme standards
- Requires professional design upgrade

## Server Information
- **URL**: http://localhost:9000/
- **Directory**: /Users/peter/
- **Main Dashboard**: service_dashboard_themed.html
