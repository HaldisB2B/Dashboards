# Dashboards Repository
## Professional Design System & Dashboard Collection

### Design Philosophy
This repository follows professional design agency standards with version-controlled design iterations. We never delete old designs - instead, we preserve them and create new proposals for comparison and evaluation.

### Repository Structure
```
├── current-version/          # Current implementation (preserved)
├── light-blue-demo/         # Perfect replica of Light Blue HTML5 theme
├── design-v2-professional/  # Enhanced business dashboard
├── design-v3-advanced/      # Feature-rich version
└── docs/                   # Documentation and standards
```

### Design Workflow
1. **Preserve Current Work**: Move existing implementations to `current-version/`
2. **Create Reference Standard**: Build pixel-perfect Light Blue HTML5 demo
3. **Gap Analysis**: Document differences between current and professional standard
4. **Iterative Design**: Create multiple design proposals (V2, V3, etc.)
5. **Professional Review**: Compare all versions for final selection
